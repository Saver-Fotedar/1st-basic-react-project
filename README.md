      <p>{description}</p>
      <span>${price}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

// Dynamic rendering with map
const jobs = [
  { 
    id: 1, 
    company: "Amazon", 
    position: "Senior UI/UX Designer",
    salary: "$120/hr",
    location: "Mumbai, India"
  },
  // ... more jobs
];

return (
  <div>
    {jobs.map((job) => (
      <JobCard key={job.id} {...job} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

**Features Implemented:**
